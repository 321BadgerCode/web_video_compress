- Calculate approximation of when compressing will end (calculate ms per mb of compression for first n number of files and assume linear rate)
- Change cache names depending on subfolders, but leave main cache.json (to not mess up actual caching), so users can store locally
- Use ffprobe to see if video is h265 and has compression percent. If so, assume it's compressed or compress only the difference to get to compression quality.
