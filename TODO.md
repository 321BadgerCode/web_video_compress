- Calculate approximation of when compressing will end (calculate ms per mb of compression for first n number of files and assume linear rate)
- Show loading bar
- Optimize render webpage (takes long time when refresh to render all files)
  - Don't delete static thumbnails if not done compressing (takes longer to load)
  - Automatically change render of isCompressed value right after compressed on backend
- Change cache names depending on subfolders, but leave main cache.json (to not mess up actual caching), so users can store locally
- Take away "compressed" attribute in JSON cache because just need to check if in cache, not compressed attribute
